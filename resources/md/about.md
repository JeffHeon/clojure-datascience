This site was born out of [a discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/clojure/vsjUlAWm64g/discussion) on the [Clojure Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure) about the state of Clojure as a language for Data Science.
One of the points of discussion led to the acknowledgement that it would be nice to have a place for finding and reviewing Data Science & Machine Learning resources, similar to the [Clojure Toolbox](http://clojure-toolbox.com).
This is a humble manifestation of that recognition.
